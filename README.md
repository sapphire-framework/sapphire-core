Sapphire is a modular JavaScript framework for the server, based on Express and built especially for APIs. We wanted something that would work out of the box for most projects, providing the facilities and services to get up and running in little to no time. Most of the packages it includes are thin wrappers to popular packages by the community, so we don't end up reinventing, but also leverage the tried and tested. It's also built upon good patterns and practices, with Dependency Injection and IOC at the center piece to combine the services together.

This project is still very early work in progress. We're still deciding on the packages it should have, their APIs and much more. In the meantime, visit us often and take a look at the commits for progress updates.
